# NMS_QoL-Tweaks
No Man's Sky - Quality of Life Tweaks

This is mainly a similar recompile of Fitz's QoL Fixes to work with the NMS v1.58 release.  So far I have everything except the exocraft changes and a few minor differences to the mining laser and boltcaster.

Some of the buildable Multitool and Suit upgrades have been buffed to make the more useful.  The Boltcaster upgrades have been changed to favor damage over speed.  So at first it may feel slow, but it is probably doing more DPS than vanilla due to the increased damage.
